Description:
Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) which is continuous. The model assumes a linear relationship, represented by a straight line equation:

Aim:
The primary aim of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to forecast a numerical outcome based on one or more predictor variables (features) from a dataset with a continuous target variable.

Objective:

1.To identify key predictors influencing the target variable through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.To build and train a linear regression model that predicts the continuous target variable.
3.To evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate regression metrics such as R², MSE, and RMSE.
4.To visualize and interpret the results, helping to provide insights into the relationship between features and the target variable.
5.To make informed decisions based on the model's predictions for practical applications like business forecasting, pricing models, etc.

Scope:
Data Collection:
                Use an appropriate dataset with continuous target variable(s) relevant to the problem you want to address (e.g., housing prices, sales forecasts, etc.).
Feature Selection and Preprocessing:
                Identify key features that influence the target variable and preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, scaling).
Model Development:
                Build and train a linear regression model to learn the relationship between the features and the target variable.
Evaluation:
                Assess the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Optimization: 
                Fine-tune the model parameters and improve its accuracy if needed.
Visualization: 
                Generate meaningful visualizations (scatter plots, residual plots) to better understand the model's predictions.
